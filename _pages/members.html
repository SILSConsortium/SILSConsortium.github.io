    The consortium consists of eleven member libraries: three municipal libraries, seven regional library systems, and
    the northern library system. The Provincial Library and Literacy Office of the Ministry of Education is also a
    member. The SILS Consortium is governed by a Board of Directors, the officers of which form an Executive Committee
    with limited decision-making power. The Board of Directors consists of the Library Directors of the eleven member
    libraries and the Provincial Librarian. Day to day operations of the consortium are delegated to the Executive
    Director and carried out by SILS Office staff.
