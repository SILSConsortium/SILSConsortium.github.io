The data below is taken from the integrated library system software used by all public libraries in Saskatchewan. These numbers highlight the growing patron base and widespread use of the public library system in Saskatchewan, the continued growth of both physical and electronic collections, and a degree of cooperation between public library systems that remains unprecedented in Canada.

Please note that not all statistics are comparable across all years due to changes in software systems in 2009-10, 2013 and 2015. Differences in each systemâ€™s data gathering and reporting methods will have affected overall numbers. The current system provides accurate and specific data which the consortium has been using to inform decision making since September 2015.

Usage in 2020 and to a lesser extent 2021 was greatly affected by the Covid19 pandemic. Library branches closed in late March 2020 and began re-opening and offering varying levels of service later in the year. The closures resulted in a large reduction in use of physical collections, followed by a rebound in the years since. Use of OverDrive ebooks and audiobooks has increased significantly over the last several years due to pandemic closures and increased investment by libraries.

As of 2023, the counts of OverDrive E-Titles are more accurate than in previous years and counts of E-Items and Unique Borrowers of E-Titles have been added.
